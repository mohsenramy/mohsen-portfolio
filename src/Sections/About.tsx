        I am a full stack software engineer with 18 years of experience and a
        successful track record as a technical manager. My expertise lies in
        leading cross-functional teams, managing project delivery, and providing
        technical support. Over the past 5 years, I have worked remotely as a
        contractor and hands-on team lead, leveraging technologies such as the
        MERN stack, MongoDB, Python, and Microsoft Azure. I have a proven
        ability to bring software solutions from concept to production, with a
        focus on building REST and GraphQL backends, and creating pixel-perfect
        React and React-Native clients with comprehensive unit and integration
        testing. Additionally, I have experience in CI/CD processes using Git
        and Microsoft Azure. As a new UpWork member, I am eager to demonstrate
        my skills and offer a special discount to build my portfolio. I take
        pride in my work and maintain a strong sense
